			<h2>About</h2>
			<img src="images/profile.jpg">
			<p>Hi! My name is Patrick Kelly and I'm a Christian, nerd, gamer, and all around awkward person. I'm currently studying Web design and development at Full Sail University. I work at a local technologies company as a technician. diagnosing and fixing computers, printers, and other pieces of technology people bring in.</p>
			<p>I feel extremely blessed to be in the position I'm currently in. Daily I get to learn about some of the things that I'm really passionate about. Through school I get to learn more about the web and how it works. I also get to learn how to develop and design for the web. It's quite an incredible feeling to be browsing the web and be able to look at something and know how to create it or something very similar to it. At work I get to enjoy another one of my passions that being technology. I really enjoy diagnosing and fixing technology. I've been interested in technology since before I bought my first laptop. Over the years my knowledge and passion for technology has grown to the point where I can work as a technician. I also really love building computers. At this current point all the desktop computers in my families house are custom and built by me. My daily driver has an i7 990X 6 core cpu clocked at 3.45 GHz, 24 gigs of ram, an R9 390 graphics card with 8 gigs of video ram, and a 3 terabyte mechanical hard-drive.</p>
			<p>I'm really excited to learn more this month and can't wait to see everyone elses progress through the month. I hope that this month will be really benificial to every one and we can all come out of it better designers.</p>

			<h2>Header</h2>
			<img src="images/header.jpg">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Designed to grab attention and with the count down, I believe the target audience to be 20-30 year-olds interested in new emerging technology.</p>
			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Because of the clear intent to catch the users attention one of the goals is to convey some information about the new technology they are working on. Another goal, made clear by the counter, being to build excitement and anticipation for this new technology.</p>
			<h3>Critique</h3>
			<p>The simplicity of the design serves the purpose to keep the message clear and to the point, avoiding confusion. The background image helps convey an idea of excitement and communicates an idea of the company being on the edge of a break through in technology. The increasing font size helps guide the attention to product of feature of said product. The products text being blue to communicate trust in said product. Because the products text is larger it allows for the message to be the most important part of the header allowings easier focus for the user.</p>

			<h2>Quick Info</h2>
			<img src="images/about.png">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Target audiance are individuals in charge of making buisness decisions. Probably individials from late 20s to 50s</p>
			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The goal here is to quickly highlight information to the user about the company and services they provide.</p>
			<h3>Critique</h3>
			<p>The rule of thirds is applied here to create an appealing layout for the information the company is trying to convey. The icons quickly distinguish between the highlighted information. The differences in fonts allow for the information stand out from the header. The Serif font conveys an idea of knowledge and trust to the users. The orangish red allows for the companies passion and creativity for their product to come through.</p>
