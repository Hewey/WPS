			<h2>About</h2>
			<img src="images/profile.jpg">
			<p>Hi! My name is Patrick Kelly and I'm a Christian, nerd, gamer, and all around awkward person. I'm currently studying Web design and development at Full Sail University. I work at a local technologies company as a technician. diagnosing and fixing computers, printers, and other pieces of technology people bring in.</p>
			<p>I feel extremely blessed to be in the position I'm currently in. Daily I get to learn about some of the things that I'm really passionate about. Through school I get to learn more about the web and how it works. I also get to learn how to develop and design for the web. It's quite an incredible feeling to be browsing the web and be able to look at something and know how to create it or something very similar to it. At work I get to enjoy another one of my passions that being technology. I really enjoy diagnosing and fixing technology. I've been interested in technology since before I bought my first laptop. Over the years my knowledge and passion for technology has grown to the point where I can work as a technician. I also really love building computers. At this current point all the desktop computers in my families house are custom and built by me. My daily driver has an i7 990X 6 core cpu clocked at 3.45 GHz, 24 gigs of ram, an R9 390 graphics card with 8 gigs of video ram, and a 3 terabyte mechanical hard-drive.</p>
			<p>I'm really excited to learn more this month and can't wait to see everyone elses progress through the month. I hope that this month will be really benificial to every one and we can all come out of it better designers.</p>

			<h2>Header</h2>
			<img src="images/header.jpg">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Designed to grab attention and with the count down, I believe the target audience to be 20-30 year-olds interested in new emerging technology.</p>
			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>Because of the clear intent to catch the users attention one of the goals is to convey some information about the new technology they are working on. Another goal, made clear by the counter, being to build excitement and anticipation for this new technology.</p>
			<h3>Critique</h3>
			<p>The simplicity of the design serves the purpose to keep the message clear and to the point, avoiding confusion. The background image helps convey an idea of excitement and communicates an idea of the company being on the edge of a break through in technology. The increasing font size helps guide the attention to product of feature of said product. The products text being blue to communicate trust in said product. Because the products text is larger it allows for the message to be the most important part of the header allowings easier focus for the user.</p>

			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The goal here is to quickly highlight information to the user about the company and services they provide.</p>
			<h3>Critique</h3>
			<p>The rule of thirds is applied here to create an appealing layout for the information the company is trying to convey. The icons quickly distinguish between the highlighted information. The differences in fonts allow for the information stand out from the header. The Serif font conveys an idea of knowledge and trust to the users. The orangish red allows for the companies passion and creativity for their product to come through.</p>

			<p>The large lettering serves to grab the users attention. The red could serve several purposes. One being to highlight the most important part of the message. Another being the strength of their services compaired to other companies. The black and white images in the background help provide confidence in their services.</p>

The larger header text allows the users to clearly distinguish each if the sections. The color choices allow for a feeling of knowlege and of a clutter free zone.</p>

			<h2>News Feed</h2>
			<img src="images/news.jpg">
			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>The target audience being gamers. Typically around the ages of 18-40.</p>
			<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
			<p>The need here is to gain the users attention to get them to read a review. A user can come here to find reviews of recent games for their relevent platform.</p>
			<h3>Critique</h3>
			<p>The feed here is using a four column layout. The larger is being used for the games title and the smaller used as a quick discription. There are screenshots used behind the text to help grab the users attention and entice them to reading the review. Red is used to highlight the fact that these are written reviews. There are colored tags indicating what platform the game review is on. The color in this design seems to be just that color. There doesn't really seem to be any signifigance to the colors other than the fact that they are colors.</p>

			<p>The design here is quite simple, but simple forms seem to be the most effective forms. The buttons are quite large which can help with more understanding on the users part. The color scheme here being back, white, and yellow is a nice blend and looks appealing. The yellow could help give the idea of joy and cheerfulness one might experience at the night club.</p>

			<h3>Critique</h3>
			<p>The design here is simple and yet elegant. At the top there is some text to guide and reassure the user that if they are a returning customer that this is the correct location. The icon being a key to symbolize unlocking. The form is again simple and reassuring to help guide the user through the login proccess. The text for a forgotten password is red so it stands out and if a user has an issue they know where to go.</p>
